## Description
Let’s practice what we’ve just learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every `<div>` appears in its own row. Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive. Some of the properties we’ll be using include:

- `display`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `grid-template-columns`
- `gap`
- `grid-column-start`
- `grid-column-end`

We’ll also cover a couple of the shorthand properties of these as well, so let’s get started!
