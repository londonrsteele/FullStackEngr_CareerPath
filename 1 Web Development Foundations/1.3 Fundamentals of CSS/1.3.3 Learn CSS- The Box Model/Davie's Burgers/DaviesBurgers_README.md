* style.css - main stylesheet

## Description
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant’s website. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the box model properties have yet to be set. You’ll use knowledge of `height`, `width`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` to complete this project.

The website’s existing **index.html** and **style.css** files are displayed in the text editor to the right. As you work, use both to see which elements you are selecting and styling. Most of the elements that you’ll need to add styles for already have rule sets in **style.css** to which you can add additional declarations.
